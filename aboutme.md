# Dylan Good

One interesting fact about me is that I am an Elden Lord. Not many people know what Elden Lord is, but it is
quite the accoomplishment. I have defeated all of the shardbearers including Starscourge Radahan, and taken their 
great runes. With all of these great runes, I was able to restore the Elden Ring and take my throne.
